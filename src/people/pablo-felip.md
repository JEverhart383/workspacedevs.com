I am the head of studies, ICT and quality management in a private educational institution in Spain. Most of my professional career has been closely related to education, both at internal management and quality assurance positions as well as a teacher/trainer at different stages and areas, from non-formal capacitation programs to formal vocational training and higher education degrees. My goal and passion is the continuous improvement of organizational and teaching/learning processes through innovative methodologies and ICT tools. I've have been using, deploying and administering G Suite (now Google Workspace) since 2010 and, more recently, leveraging Google Sheets, Apps Script, Data Studio and other Google services to build automations that improve the workflows of corporate processes, provide performance insights and assist in decision-making situations. I am a member of GEG (Google Educator Group) Spain's coordination team since 2018.
