I'm a teacher turned instructional coach. I use Apps Script to build tools for efficiency. Past experiments include [Endnote Generator](https://github.com/bennettscience/endnotes) and [DocuTube](https://github.com/bennettscience/docutube) (now archived). You can see other snippets and examples on [my blog](https://blog.ohheybrian.com/tag/google-apps-script/). Aside from Apps Script, I use Python to create extensions and apps to extend our LMS for teachers and students.
